# If Staments & While Loops

# We can use 'if' statements to excute code if a given condition is met.
# To check if two variables are the same we use DOUBLE equals (==)
# Python is case sensitive. 'Hello' is not the same as 'hello'.
# We can get around this by using .lower()
# While loops are useful when we want the program to loop until a given condition is met but we dont know
#  how many times it needs to loop

# If Statements!
#create a variable to loop my code
like_coffee = input("Do you like coffee? ").lower()
if like_coffee == "yes" or like_coffee == "y":
  print("I dont like you")
elif like_coffee == "no" or like_coffee == "n":
 print("You are not missing out")
elif like_coffee == "hey" or "hi":
   print("hi?, You need to awnser the question")
else:
  print("what?")
